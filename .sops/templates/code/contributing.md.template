Thank you for contributing! This guide explains how to get started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone {your-fork-url}`
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
4. Make changes and write tests
5. Commit using conventional commits (see below)
6. Push and open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

See [README.md](README.md#-getting-started) for full setup instructions.

## Code Style

- Follow the project ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Run `pnpm lint` before committing
- Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting automatically

## Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```

### Types

## Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation if needed
2. Ensure all tests pass (`pnpm test`)
3. Ensure lint passes (`pnpm lint`)
4. Request review from at least one team member
5. Squash and merge after approval

## Reporting Issues
