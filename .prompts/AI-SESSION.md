### Session 5 — 2026-02-08

**SOPs Completed:** SOP-005 (Design Patterns)
**Files Created:**

- `/docs/architecture/patterns.md` — Comprehensive design patterns documentation (130+ KB)
  **Design Decisions:**
- **Architectural Pattern:** Modular Monolith (selected over microservices)
  - Best fit for small team size (1-2 developers)
  - Critical time to market (MVP launch)
  - Progressive scalability (Vercel handles horizontal scaling)
  - Clear domain boundaries (lists, pantry, AI, collaboration)
- **Application Layer:** Feature-Based Organization
  - Features organized in `src/features/` with self-contained modules
  - Each feature contains: components/, hooks/, services/, types.ts
  - Clear dependency flow: App Router → Features → Lib/Shared
- **Data Access:** Repository Pattern
  - Centralized database operations in `src/lib/repositories/`
  - Clean interface for Prisma queries
  - Easy to mock for testing
  - Example repositories: list.repository.ts, item.repository.ts, user.repository.ts
- **Business Logic:** Service Pattern
  - Feature-specific services in `src/features/[feature]/services/`
  - Encapsulates complex workflows (e.g., complete shopping trip)
  - Coordinates multiple repositories and external services
  - Example: listService.createList(), listService.addItem(), listService.shareList()
- **React State:** Custom Hooks Pattern
  - Reusable stateful logic in hooks (useShoppingList, useRealtimeList)
  - Separates data fetching from UI components
  - React Query integration for server state management
    **Component Patterns:**
- **Container/Presenter:** Separates logic (Container) from UI (Presenter)
- **Compound Components:** Flexible component APIs with shared context (e.g., Card.Header, Card.Body)
- **Render Props:** Share code via function props for customizable rendering
  **Additional Patterns:**
- **Factory Pattern:** Object creation for notifications (email, push)
- **Strategy Pattern:** Interchangeable algorithms for AI suggestions
- **Custom Error Classes:** Structured error handling (NotFoundError, UnauthorizedError, ValidationError)
  **Documentation Includes:**
- Architectural pattern evaluation and decision matrix
- Complete feature-based folder structure with 6 feature modules
- Repository pattern implementation with base interfaces
- Service pattern implementation with real-world examples
- Custom hooks implementation with React Query
- Component patterns with TypeScript code examples
- Factory and Strategy patterns for flexible implementations
- Error handling patterns with custom error classes
- Testing patterns for repositories and services
- Pattern selection guidelines (when to use each pattern)
- Anti-patterns to avoid (God components, prop drilling, etc.)
  **Notes:**
- 1000+ lines of comprehensive pattern documentation
- Modular Monolith allows future extraction to microservices if needed
- Feature-based organization aligns with Next.js 14 App Router
- Repository + Service pattern creates clean separation of concerns
- All patterns include TypeScript examples specific to Listly domain
- Ready for SOP-006 (Code Style Standards)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **AI manages this file** — Human only provides initial project description
2. **Always read SOPs first** — Don't assume; follow the documented procedure
3. **Check prerequisites** — Ensure previous SOP outputs exist before starting
4. **Update after each SOP** — Keep this tracker current
5. **Document deviations** — Note any departures from SOPs in the session log
